# BioPyPatRec
This repository contains the main contributions of my master’s thesis dealing with recurrent neural networks for motor volition.

The software is build on top of BioPatRec (https://github.com/biopatrec/biopatrec), a Matlab-based software for the control of artiﬁcial limbs based on pattern recognition algorithms.
